# ML-clustering

This project contains two part:

1. Implement the k-means algorithm using the Mahalanobis distance instead of the standard Euclidean distance

result: Based on the following experimental results, K-Means operating with Mahalanobis distance works undoubtedly better than K-Means equipped with Euclidean distance and a centroid-based cluster representative for linearly correlated elliptical data

3. Implement the Davies-Bouldin index for cluster validation (intrinsic cluster validation). For this part of the project, use the standard k-means implementation operating with the Euclidean distance and centroids as cluster representatives.

result: figure out the Davies-Bouldin index for better clustering, for this dataset, 3.
