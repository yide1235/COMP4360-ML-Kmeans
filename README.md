# ML-clustering

This project contains two part:
1. Implement the k-means algorithm using the Mahalanobis distance instead of the standard Euclidean distance
2. Implement the Davies-Bouldin index for cluster validation (intrinsic cluster validation). For this part of the project, use the standard k-means implementation operating with the Euclidean distance and centroids as cluster representatives.
